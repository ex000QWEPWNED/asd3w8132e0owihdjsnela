Did you know that there are 5 planets in the average solar system!

There is also a 0.001% chance for there to be an extra planet!

Maybe even one day we'll see a solar system with 7 planets!

In fact, a long time ago, 6, 3 and 4 planets were found in solar systems!

The more planets, the hotter the solar systems is!

The universe has more stars than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth!

There's a 0.00001% chance a shooting star you see is actually a satellite!

We may one day discover an Earth-like planet in a distant galaxy!

There have been 4, 2, and even 5 moons around planets discovered in the past!

The more moons a planet has, the more its gravitational field is perturbed!

Some nebulae are so large they could fit 1,000 of our solar systems inside!

There's a 0.00001% chance a nebula could collapse to form a star each year!

It's possible we'll find a nebula larger than our entire galaxy!

Astronomers have discovered nebulae of 3, 2, and even 6 light years across!

The larger a nebula is, the more stars it can potentially birth!

The deepest part of our ocean could fit 3.5 Mount Everests!

There's a 0.001% chance of discovering a new underwater species every dive!

Maybe one day we'll discover an ocean on another planet deeper than ours!

We've found seas at depths of 2, 3, and even 7 kilometers on Earth!

The deeper the sea, the more bizarre and fascinating creatures live in it!

A lightning bolt can be five times hotter than the sun's surface!

There's a 0.00001% chance you could capture a triple lightning strike in a photo!

Perhaps one day we'll see a planet where it's always a thunderstorm!

In the past, simultaneous strikes of 2, 3, and 4 have been recorded!

The more lightning there is, the higher the amount of nitrogen in the soil!

You know, the Milky Way is just one of an estimated 2 trillion galaxies in the universe!

There's a 0.00001% chance we could detect an intelligent signal from a distant galaxy!

Maybe one day we'll find a galaxy that's entirely composed of dark matter!

Galaxies with 2 billion, 3 billion, and even 6 billion stars have been discovered!

The more galaxies there are in a cluster, the greater the chance of a gravitational lensing event!

Some black holes are so massive that they outweigh our sun by billions of times!

There's a 0.00001% chance a star could turn into a black hole in our lifetime!

Perhaps one day we'll see a black hole consuming a neutron star!

Black holes with 5, 3, and 10 solar masses have been found!

The more massive the black hole, the larger its event horizon!

The largest asteroid in our solar system is so big you could fit 750 Earths inside!

There's a 0.001% chance an asteroid could hit Earth in the next century!

Maybe one day we'll be able to mine asteroids for precious resources!

Asteroids of 500, 700, and even 1,000 kilometers in diameter have been discovered!

The more asteroids in a belt, the greater the chance of a meteor shower on a nearby planet!

A comet's tail can stretch for millions of kilometers, longer than the distance from Earth to Mars!

There's a 0.001% chance a new comet could be discovered this year!

Perhaps one day we'll see a comet that outshines the moon!

Comets with orbits of 5, 50, and even 500 years have been observed!

The more comets there are in a solar system, the more likely it is to have a spectacular night sky!

The universe is so large, it would take 225 million years for us to travel across our own galaxy at the speed of light!

There's a 0.00001% chance we could achieve faster-than-light travel in our lifetime!

Maybe one day we'll be able to teleport instantaneously across the universe!

Journeys taking 4, 3, and even 7 years at light speed have been theoretically calculated!

The faster we can travel, the more of the universe we can explore!

Some alien life forms might breathe sulfur or methane instead of oxygen!

There's a 0.001% chance we could discover microbial alien life this decade!

Perhaps one day we'll encounter a civilization that is billions of years older than us!

Alien life forms based on 2, 3, or even 4 different biochemistries have been hypothesized!

The more diverse life is in the universe, the more we can learn about our own origins!

A neutron star is so dense that a teaspoon of its material would weigh about 10 million tons!

There's a 0.00001% chance we could detect a neutron star collision this year!

Maybe one day we'll harness the power of neutron stars for interstellar travel!

Neutron stars with 1.4, 2, and even 2.5 solar masses have been discovered!

The denser a neutron star, the stronger its magnetic field!

The highest mountain on Mars, Olympus Mons, is nearly three times the height of Mount Everest!

There's a 0.01% chance we could establish a human colony on Mars this century!

Perhaps one day we'll terraform Mars to have a breathable atmosphere!

Mountains of 2, 3, and even 6 kilometers high have been discovered on other planets!

The taller the mountain, the colder its peak!

The Kepler space telescope has discovered over 2,600 confirmed exoplanets!

There's a 0.1% chance we could find an Earth-sized exoplanet in a habitable zone this year!

Maybe one day we'll send a probe to an exoplanet in another star system!

Exoplanets with 2, 1, and even 0.5 Earth masses have been discovered!

The more exoplanets we discover, the better we understand our place in the universe!

Some pulsars rotate so quickly, they spin hundreds of times per second!

There's a 0.00001% chance a pulsar could be used as a cosmic GPS system!

Perhaps one day we'll detect a pulsar in another galaxy!

Pulsars with rotation periods of 1.5, 0.03, and even 0.001 seconds have been discovered!

The faster a pulsar spins, the younger it is!

The largest volcano in the solar system is on Mars and is the size of the state of Arizona!

There's a 0.00001% chance we could witness an extraterrestrial volcanic eruption!

Maybe one day we'll use the geothermal energy from Martian volcanoes!

Volcanoes of 2, 3, and even 4 kilometers high have been discovered on other moons!

The bigger the volcano, the more it can alter a planet's or moon's atmosphere!

The magnetic field of Jupiter is 14 times stronger than Earth's!

There's a 0.001% chance we could discover a planet with a stronger magnetic field than Jupiter!

Perhaps one day we'll use planetary magnetic fields for energy!

Planets with magnetic fields of 1, 2, and even 4 Gauss have been observed!

The stronger the magnetic field, the more it protects a planet from solar radiation!
