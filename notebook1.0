Did you know that there are 5 planets in the average solar system!

There is also a 0.001% chance for there to be an extra planet!

Maybe even one day we'll see a solar system with 7 planets!

In fact, a long time ago, 6, 3 and 4 planets were found in solar systems!

The more planets, the hotter the solar systems is!

The universe has more stars than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth!

There's a 0.00001% chance a shooting star you see is actually a satellite!

We may one day discover an Earth-like planet in a distant galaxy!

There have been 4, 2, and even 5 moons around planets discovered in the past!

The more moons a planet has, the more its gravitational field is perturbed!

Some nebulae are so large they could fit 1,000 of our solar systems inside!

There's a 0.00001% chance a nebula could collapse to form a star each year!

It's possible we'll find a nebula larger than our entire galaxy!

Astronomers have discovered nebulae of 3, 2, and even 6 light years across!

The larger a nebula is, the more stars it can potentially birth!

The deepest part of our ocean could fit 3.5 Mount Everests!

There's a 0.001% chance of discovering a new underwater species every dive!

Maybe one day we'll discover an ocean on another planet deeper than ours!

We've found seas at depths of 2, 3, and even 7 kilometers on Earth!

The deeper the sea, the more bizarre and fascinating creatures live in it!

A lightning bolt can be five times hotter than the sun's surface!

There's a 0.00001% chance you could capture a triple lightning strike in a photo!

Perhaps one day we'll see a planet where it's always a thunderstorm!

In the past, simultaneous strikes of 2, 3, and 4 have been recorded!

The more lightning there is, the higher the amount of nitrogen in the soil!
